# DAGS-v1.0
A normative, implementation-neutral standard defining deployment-layer governance validity conditions for AI systems, including accountability, authority attribution, and independently verifiable evidence generation.

**1. Purpose of This Repository**

This repository contains the Deployment AI Governance Standard (DAGS) and its associated governing materials.
DAGS defines normative deployment-layer governance requirements for AI systems in operation. It is designed to be read, applied, and relied upon by enterprises, insurers, regulators, auditors, and governance practitioners.
This README exists to:
Orient readers to the structure of the repository
Clearly identify which materials are normative and binding
Prevent misinterpretation, substitution, or misuse
Establish how the standard must be read and applied

**2. Normative Authority**

The only normative content in this repository is located in: DAGS_v1.0/
That folder contains the complete and authoritative DAGS v1.0 normative standard, including:
- Governance rules
- Control domains and requirements
- Evidence principles
- Control registry
- Prohibitions and constraints
- Normative appendices

Nothing outside DAGS_v1.0/ modifies, interprets, weakens, or substitutes for those requirements.

Requirements documents contain binding control obligations. Domain Overview documents provide normative context but do not introduce additional control obligations beyond their associated Requirements documents.
If a statement, explanation, or artifact conflicts with the normative text, the normative text governs.

**3. Repository Structure (High-Level)**

This document set is organized as a single normative standard package:

**4. How to Read DAGS**
Readers should proceed in the following order:

- **00_Governance/** (scope, authority, language, versioning)
- **01_Standard_Overview/** (purpose, audience, applicability)
- **02_Control_Domains/** (requirements and evidence principles)
- **03_Control_Registry/** (control identifiers and stability rules)
- **04_Evidence_Framework/** (evidence definitions and constraints)
- **05_Cross-Cutting_Requirements/** (requirements spanning domains)
- **06_Prohibitions_and_Constraints/** (explicit prohibitions and misuse rules)
- **07_Appendices_(Normative)/** (definitions, legal notices, references)
- **08_Operational_Guidance_(Non-Normative)** (non-normative guidance)
  
Read the normative standard as a single, complete package.

Defined terms shall be interpreted exclusively as defined in the normative Definitions appendix. Informal or colloquial interpretations are prohibited.

Materials outside the normative folder are explanatory only.

**5. What DAGS Is — and Is Not**

DAGS is:
- A deployment-layer AI governance standard
- Normative and requirements-based
- Evidence-oriented without prescribing procedures
- System-scoped and version-stable

DAGS is not:
- A certification program
- A maturity model
- A scoring framework
- An implementation guide
- A substitute for regulation or law
No claim of certification, approval, endorsement, or compliance is authorized.

**6. Use and Reliance**

DAGS may be used for:
- Governance assessment and analysis
- Risk disclosure and oversight
- Insurer, regulator, or auditor review
- Internal governance design and evaluation

Use of DAGS does not guarantee outcomes, safety, legality, or acceptance by any authority.

**7. Version Status**

This repository contains DAGS v1.0, a foundational normative release.
v1.0 is complete and authoritative
v1.0 is immutable
Future versions will be explicitly versioned and published
All references to DAGS must cite the applicable version.
Errata, if issued, will be versioned and published separately without retroactive modification of this release.

**8. Misuse Warning**

Any use of this repository that:
- Alters normative requirements
- Substitutes other frameworks or tools
- Implies certification or endorsement
- Selectively represents conformance
constitutes misuse of the standard.
Public representations inconsistent with normative requirements may constitute unauthorized use of the standard.
Misuse invalidates claims of DAGS alignment.

**9. Final Authority Statement**

If there is any doubt about meaning, scope, applicability, or obligation:
- The entirety of the DAGS v1.0 package, as contained within the DAGS_v1.0 directory, is normative and controlling.
